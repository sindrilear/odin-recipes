About the project:

This is a very basic website that contains links to recipes with a list of ingredients and instructions on how to cook the meals. 

By doing this project I will be working on basic html formatting, and committing to github. I will practise using unordered and ordered lists, hyperlinking between pages and working with texts and images.
