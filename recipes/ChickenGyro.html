        <h4>Additions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup quartered cherry tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup diced cucumber</li>
                <li>1/4 cup diced red onion</li>
                <li>1/3 cup kalamata olives</li>
                <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups cooked brown rice</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by cooking the rice. While the rice cooks combine the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, parsley, olive oil, and dried spices in a bowl. Add in the cubed chicken and let it marinate for 30-60 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the chicken marinates make the tzatziki sauce. Combine Greek yogurt, shredded cucumber, lemon juice, garlic, and fresh dill. Be sure to squeeze as much of the liquid out of the cucumbers as you can. Stir everything together and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Chop the cucumber, tomatoes, olives, and red onion.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, add some olive oil and when itâ€™s hot throw in the chicken. Let it cook for several minutes before flipping it over. This will allow it to brown and get a light crust on the outside.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken is cooked through remove it from the heat and assemble the bowls.</li>
                <li>Fill the bowl with rice and then top it with some of the chicken, cucumbers, red onion, tomatoes, kalamata olives, crumbled feta, and a big dollop of tzatziki sauce.</li>
            </ol>
